Big Mart Sales Prediction using Machine Learning with Python. In this project, XGBoost Regressor is used for Prediction.

The topic of "Big Mart Sales Prediction using Machine Learning with Python" is focused on using
machine learning algorithms to predict sales in a retail setting. 

The goal is to create a predictive  model that can accurately forecast sales for individual products in different stores.

The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, where missing values and outliers are 
handled, and the data is prepared for analysis. 

The next step is exploratory data analysis, where various data visualizations are used to gain insights into the data and identify trends and 
patterns.

The project then moves on to feature engineering, where new features are created from the existing data to improve the accuracy of the predictive model. 
The final step is to use the predictive model to make sales predictions for new data. 

Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting sales in a retail setting, and highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation in building an accurate and reliable predictive model.

In this project, we aimed to predict the sales of a retail store based on various features such as the item's fat content, type, store location, and more. To achieve this, we used the XGBoost regression algorithm, which is known to perform well in many regression tasks.

First, we performed exploratory data analysis on the dataset and identified some data cleaning steps such as filling in missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and encoding categorical features using one-hot encoding. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, we split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio.

Next, we trained the XGBoost regressor on the training data and evaluated the model's performance on the test data using the R-squared metric. We achieved an R-squared value of 0.60, which indicates that the model explains 60% of the variance in the sales data. This is a relatively good performance, considering that there are likely many factors affecting sales that are not captured in the dataset.

Finally, we analyzed the feature importance scores produced by the XGBoost model to gain insights into which features have the most significant impact on sales. We found that the item's MRP (maximum retail price), the size of the store, and the location of the store were the most important features.

Overall, our XGBoost model performed well in predicting the sales of the retail store based on various features, and we gained insights into which features have the most significant impact on sales.
