# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction-
Big Mart Sales Prediction using Machine Learning with Python. In this project, XGBoost Regressor is used for Prediction.
The topic of "Big Mart Sales Prediction using Machine Learning with Python" is focused on using
machine learning algorithms to predict sales in a retail setting. The goal is to create a predictive 
model that can accurately forecast sales for individual products in different stores.
The project begins with data cleaning and preprocessing, where missing values and outliers are 
handled, and the data is prepared for analysis. The next step is exploratory data analysis, where
various data visualizations are used to gain insights into the data and identify trends and 
patterns.
The project then moves on to feature engineering, where new features are created from the 
existing data to improve the accuracy of the predictive model. 
The final step is to use the predictive model to make sales predictions for new data. 
Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms in predicting 
sales in a retail setting, and highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature 
engineering, and model evaluation in building an accurate and reliable predictive model.
